# Task Management Dashboard

A responsive, feature-rich **Task Management Dashboard** built with **React 19** and **TypeScript**. It supports full CRUD operations, real-time search and multi-filter, dual view modes (List & Grid), dark/light theme toggle, and data persistence via `localStorage` — entirely frontend with no backend required.

## Features

### 1) Landing Page ( 🎁 Bonus Feature )

- A clean welcome screen that greets the user.
- User can optionally enter their **name**, which is stored in `sessionStorage` and displayed in the header as a personalized greeting (e.g., "Welcome, Arvind").
- Clicking **"Get Started"** navigates to the Task Dashboard.

---

### 2) Task Dashboard

**Summary Stats ( 🎁 Bonus Feature ):**
- Displays **3 stat cards** at the top — **Total Tasks**, **Pending Tasks**, and **Completed Tasks**.
- Stats update in real time as tasks are added, edited, or deleted.

**Add Task:**
- Click the **"Add Task"** button in the header to open a modal dialog.
- Form fields:
  - **Title** *(required)*
  - **Description** *(optional)*
  - **Status** — `Todo` / `In Progress` / `Completed`
  - **Priority** — `Low` / `Medium` / `High`
  - **Due Date** — Date picker (minimum date is today for new tasks)
- Validation is powered by **Yup** schema + **react-hook-form**.
- Default values: Status → `Todo`, Priority → `Medium`, Due Date → 7 days from today.

**Edit Task:**
- Each task card has an **Edit** button.
- Opens the same form pre-filled with existing task data.
- Click **"Update Task"** to save changes.

**Delete Task:**
- Each task card has a **Delete** button.
- A **Confirmation Dialog** appears before deletion to prevent accidents.

**Quick Status Update:**
- Each task card has an inline **Status dropdown** — change status directly without opening the edit dialog.

---

### 3) Search & Filtering

**Real-time Search:**
- Search by task **title or description** with a **300ms debounce** to avoid excessive re-renders.

**Filter by Status:**
- Multi-select dropdown — filter tasks by one or multiple statuses at the same time (e.g., show only `Todo` + `In Progress`).

**Filter by Priority:**
- Multi-select dropdown — filter tasks by one or multiple priorities simultaneously.

**Sort Order:**
- Tasks are always sorted **newest first** by creation date.

**Filter Persistence ( 🎁 Bonus Feature ):**
- Active filters and search query are saved to `localStorage` and restored on next visit.

---

### 4) List View & Grid View ( 🎁 Bonus Feature )

Toggle between two display modes:

- **List View** — Virtualized using `react-window`'s `FixedSizeList` for smooth performance even with hundreds of tasks.
- **Grid View** — Responsive CSS grid (1 column on mobile, 2 on tablet, 3 on desktop).

Each task card displays:
- Title, description (truncated), status badge (with color), priority chip (with color), due date chip
- **Overdue tasks** are highlighted with a red due date chip.

---

### 5) Dark / Light Theme ( 🎁 Bonus Feature )

- Toggle between **Dark Mode** and **Light Mode** via the icon in the app header.
- Theme preference is persisted in `localStorage` via Zustand's `persist` middleware.

---

### 6) Data Persistence & Demo Tasks

- All tasks are automatically saved to **`localStorage`** — data survives page refreshes and browser restarts.
- **5 pre-loaded demo tasks** are shown on first visit so the dashboard isn't empty.

---

### 7) Responsive Design

- Fully responsive across **mobile (320px+), tablet, and desktop** screen sizes.
- Built using Material UI's responsive `sx` props, breakpoints, and `useMediaQuery`.

---

### 8) TypeScript ( 🎁 Bonus Feature )

- Entire codebase written in **TypeScript** — strict type safety across components, stores, utilities, and validation schemas.
- Custom interfaces and types defined for all data structures (`Task`, `TaskFormData`, `FilterState`, etc.).
